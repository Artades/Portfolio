		"<p>Hi, my name's <span>Artyom</span> and I'm a passionate web developer who started learning HTML and CSS at the age of 16. From there, I continued my journey by exploring JavaScript and TypeScript and diving into various frameworks. I began by learning Angular and later expanded my knowledge to include Vue and React, as well as React Native for mobile app development.</p>" +
		"<p>Recently, I've switched to Next.js, a popular React framework that offers server-side rendering and other advanced features. Additionally, I've been honing my skills in Node.js, which has allowed me to create more complex and scalable web applications.</p>" +
